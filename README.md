Development is now occurring on the Cicoin-Core repo
As of 2022, development has now moved to the Taobot organization, under the Cicoin repo


What is Cicoin?
Cicoin (CICX) is a highly secure, decentralized, distributed and time-tested global blockchain that was founded in early 2019 with a focus on cyber security, payments & secure communications technologies.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Cicoin Core software, see https://taobot.org

You can mine Cicoin on X11 algorithms. This allows for much greater decentralization than other blockchains. 
making Cicoin much more secure against PoW attacks.

Cicoin vs Bitcoin
Security:

Cicoin mining is much more decentralized.

Cicoin mining algorithms can be changed out in the future to prevent centralization.

Cicoin transactions occur much faster than Bitcoin transactions.
1-2 second transaction notifications.
6 minute Cicoin blocks vs. 10 minute Bitcoin blocks*

Multi-Algorithm (X11): Employs a sequence of 11 different hashing algorithms, which can make it more resistant to certain types of attacks compared to using a single algorithm (SHA-256).

Has been adopted by some cryptocurrencies, like Dash, for its mining algorithm, potentially offering a more balanced approach to security and mining efficiency. 

License
Cicoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
The develop branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Additionally, the develop branch represents ongoing development from which candidate releases will be cut. The master branch represents the current stable version currently in production. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Cicoin Core. Finally, feature/{a-new-feature} branches represent current development destined for future releases.

The contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Testing
Automated Testing
Developers are required to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for any old code that is changed. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check. Further details on running and extending unit tests can be found in /src/test/README.md.

There are also regression and integration tests, written in Python, that are run automatically on the build server. These tests can be run (if the test dependencies are installed) with: test/functional/test_runner.py

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
Changes are required be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. A test plan must be included with the pull request description if testing the changes is not straightforward.
